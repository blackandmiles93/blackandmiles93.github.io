This game is Tic Tac Toe.

This game is operated via turn count which switch the symbols utilized every turn.

Odd turns are "X", while even turns are "O".

Game rules:

In order to play you need to select the single player or multiplayer button at the bottom.

If single player, you will play an AI.

If you play multiplayer, you will play with a switch click.
Methodology:

Multiplayer:
	The multiplayer was done using a turn count as opposed to 2 individual players. An odd numbered turn will be an "X" while and even numbered turn will be an "O". This was done by using an event.target.
  
  The symbols are placed using a click function; you simply click on a square and it will place the symbol at that point.

Single Player:
  The human player is the same concept as the multiplayer.

  The AI was done using randomized numbers listed from the amount of boxes and then were concatenated with the string which contains the id of the boxes. This allows the computer to interate through the boxes and randomly select a box that does not have a value in it already.

  The CSS is fairly rudimentary. The background is black with cyan and blue squares that act as the game board.

  The css may be animated...
